            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE intelligent and ſearching Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, finding in this Book, under the Title of <hi>The Apoſtolical and true Opinion, concerning the Holy Trinity, Revived and Aſſerted,</hi> &amp;c. ſeveral Explications of Holy Scripture, and Teſtimonies out of the moſt ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Writers, touching that great and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous Doctrine, much differing from the commonly-receiv'd Opinions of both Papiſts and Proteſtants of theſe later Ages, will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, be deſirous to know ſomething of the Author's Life and Qualifications. Let him pleaſe therefore to take this plain and ſhort Account, without thoſe Embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which the Lives of eminent Men are deſervedly adorned with, but which my A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities will not reach to.</p>
            <p>Know then, that the Author, <hi>John Bidle,</hi> was born at <hi>Wotton-under-hedg,</hi> in the County of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> in the Year of our Lord Chriſt, 1615. His Father, <hi>Edward Bidle,</hi> was of a middle ſort of Yeomen, and alſo dealt in Woollen Clothes; by which means he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his Family honeſtly, and with credit ſuitable to his Rank, or rather above it. His
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:132760:3"/>
Son <hi>John,</hi> our Author, was educated in the Free-School of that Town; where his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in the Learning there taught, was ſoon taken notice of, both by Neighbours, and thoſe more remote; among whom my Lord <hi>Barkley,</hi> as a Perſonage of the greateſt Honour, ſo great a lover and promoter of Learning, is in the firſt place to be remembred. Who in reſpect to the early Bloſſoms of a rare Wit, great Probity and Ingenuity in our young Scholar, conferr'd upon him the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of ten Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> among other the poorer Scholars; although by his Age, being not of ten Years, he was not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, according to common Method, for that Donation. And this Favour, it ſeems, added greater Vigour and Induſtry to the Youth's Studies; for after this, he did not only with eaſe ſurpaſs thoſe his School-fellows of the ſame Rank, but, in Time, even out-run his Inſtructions, and became Tutor to himſelf; ſo overcoming both the Labours of his Task, and thoſe Difficulties he met with in his Courſe. However, the want of fit Teaching on the one hand, and the benefit of that Exhibition on the other, or perhaps the want of fit Proviſions for a Student in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, detain'd him longer in that School, than was otherwiſe for his Improvement; for here he continued till he was about Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years of Age. In this Time he gave ſome Specimens of his pregnant, both Wit and Judgment, in the Tranſlation of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Bucolicks,</hi> and the two firſt Satyrs of <hi>Juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> into elegant Engliſh Verſe; afterward publiſh'd in print, with approbation of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men. He compoſed alſo, and recited, before a full Auditory, an elaborate Oration in Latin, for a gracing to the Funeral of an honourable School-fellow. Yea, even in theſe younger Years was obſerved in him a ſingular piety of Mind, and contempt of ſecular Affairs; Whence it came, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf to the ſtudy of Vertue, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Liberal Arts; and with great diligence gave dutiful Aſſiſtance to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, become a Widow by the Death of his Father.</p>
            <p>From hence he was ſent to the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and was admitted a Student in <hi>Magdalen-Hall</hi> there; where, in due time, he proceeded Maſter of Arts with good ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, and was reckon'd among thoſe of his rank, that did in an eſpecial manner commend the Learning of that Academy. Here he did ſo Philoſophize, as it might be obſerved, he was determined more by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than Authority; however, in Divine Things he did not much diſſent from the common Doctrine, as may be collected from a little Tract he wrote againſt Dancing. But the fame of his Learning and Prudence in inſtructing Pupils there, having conciliated to him the Eſteem of Perſons of Quality, and more particularly of the Overſeers of the School of <hi>Wootton,</hi> he was choſen by them to ſucceed in the Maſterſhip thereof; which he may ſeem to have as wiſely as modeſtly refuſed, but did in the mean time commend to them, another fit Perſon, whom they accepted of. This refuſal gave oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to the Magiſtrates of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> upon ample Recommendations of the principal Perſons in the Univerſity, to chuſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune him to be Maſter of the Free-School of <hi>Criſps</hi> in that City; which he conſented to; and at his approach thither, was met and received by them with much Joy and Honour, <hi>Anno</hi> 1641. Neither did he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Expectations, nor come ſhort of the Character had been given of him, whilſt he diſcharged that Imployment with ſuch skil and faithfulneſs, that they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not a little happy in that behalf, who could commit their Sons to his Inſtruction. Whence it came to paſs, that not ſo much by the Salary, which is not great, but by the Gratuities of Parents, he reap'd conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Profits. But Money did not infect his Mind with the love of it; his Mind was ſet upon the Knowledg of Divine Truth, and that, not for Curioſity, but for the Love of Chriſt, who is Truth and Life. And having laid aſide the Impediments of Prejudice, he gave himſelf liberty to try all things, that he might hold faſt that which is good. Thus diligently reading the Holy Scripture, (for <hi>Socinian</hi> Books he had read
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:132760:3"/>
none) and fervently imploring Divine Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, he perceiv'd the common Doctrin concerning the Holy Trinity was not well grounded in Revelation, much leſs in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And being as generous in ſpeaking, as free in judging, he did, as occaſion offered, diſcover his Reaſons of queſtioning it: Which ſome Zealots not being able to bear, they accus'd him to the Magiſtrates of Hereſy in that Point, before whom he exhibited in Writing this Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 2, 1644.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I believe there is but one Infinite and Almighty Eſſence, called God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I believe, that as there is but one Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and Almighty Eſſence, ſo there is but one Perſon in that Eſſence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I believe that our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt is truly God, by being truly, really and properly united to the only Perſon of the Infinite and Almighty Eſſence.</p>
            <p>But when this did not ſatisfy the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, but they did ſtill preſs upon him to acknowledg three Perſons in the Divine Eſſence, and he, it ſeems, knowing that the word Perſons, when aſcribed to God, is taken both by the Ancient Fathers, and by Modern Writers in various Significations, did, about fourteen days after, confeſs that that there are three in that one Divine Eſſence commonly termed Perſons.</p>
            <p>By this it appears, that how diſtinct ſoever he might be in his Conceptions concerning the Trinity, yet he was not determinate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in his expreſſing of that matter, as he became not long after. For now proceeding ſincerely in his ſearch of holy Scripture, and in earneſt Prayer to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God for his Aſſiſtance, he attained that firmneſs of Underſtanding and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that diſtinctneſs of Expreſſion, that he ſet himſelf to confer with his Familiars, and open his Mind freely upon thoſe Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of one God, and three Perſons. And not only ſo, but he alſo wrote ſome pithy Arguments againſt the ſuppoſed Deity of the Holy Spirit, whom yet he held to be the third Perſon in the Holy Trinity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a certain unfaithful Perſon betraying him to the Magiſtrate, and the Commiſſioners of Parliament there reſiding, (for then was there War between the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) he was committed <hi>Dec.</hi> 2. 1645, to the common Goal (tho at that time afflicted with a ſore Fever) there to be detained till a fit occaſion of preſenting him before the Parliament at <hi>London</hi> (which was then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with <hi>Geneva</hi>-Zeal againſt ſuch Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks) to be puniſhed as they ſhould deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. But now an eminent Perſon of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> commiſerating his Caſe, procured his Inlargemert upon Security for an Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as aforeſaid, which Mr. <hi>Bidle</hi> made accordingly when ſummoned thereto, about ſix Months after. And the Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed not to take Cognizance of his Cauſe, for they preſently choſe a Committee to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine him; who freely confeſt before them, that he did deny the commonly believ'd Deity of the Holy Ghoſt, whereof he was accus'd; but was ready to hear what could be oppos'd to him, and to acknowledg his Error, if he could not maintain it for Truth. But being wearied with no leſs long than chargeable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, he wrote the Letter hereafter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, dated <hi>April</hi> 1, 1647, to an eminent Knight, a Member of Parliament, praying he would report his Caſe to their Houſe, that he might be either judged or diſcharged. But what followed thence was the Commitment of Mr. <hi>Bidle</hi> to the Cuſtody of one of their Officers (which Reſtraint continued for five Years enſuing) and the referring him to the Aſſembly of the Presbyterian Divines, then ſitting at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> for his Conviction: Before ſome of which he often appear'd, and gave them in Writing his Arguments againſt the Deity of the Holy Spirit; but neither in Diſcourſes nor in Writing could he obtain any pertinent, much leſs ſolid Anſwer. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that, they ſolicite the Parliament, in whoſe hands was the ſupream Power at that time, and procure a Draconick Ordinance (<hi>May</hi> 2. 1648.) for inflicting the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Death upon thoſe that held Opinions contrary to the Presbyterian Points about the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:132760:4"/>
Trinity, and other Doctrines, whom they named Blaſphemers and Hereticks, and ſevere Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon thoſe that differ'd in leſſer matters. This ſeemed a Damnatory Sentence againſt Mr. <hi>Bidle,</hi> which there was no eſcape from. But it pleaſed the Almighty to make way for him, by a Diſſention in the Parliament it ſelf; to the better part whereof the Army joyn'd its Power, as for other Reaſons, ſo for that there were in it many both Officers and Souldiers, liable to the Severities of that mention'd Ordinance, which therefore from that time for divers Years lay unregarded.</p>
            <p>Before this he had publiſhed the <hi>Twelve Arguments againſt the Deity of the Holy Spirit,</hi> and this Year his Confeſſion of Faith touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Trinity, which were both Reprinted, <hi>Anno</hi> 1653. together with moſt clear and full Teſtimonies for the Unity of the Perſon of God in diſtinction from the Son and Spirit, out of certain moſt celebrated Chriſtian Fathers, who lived in the firſt Ages after Chriſt, and others. Now the Zealots in Parliament againſt Diſſenters being exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he had more liberty allow'd by his Keeper, who ſuffered him upon Security given to go into <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> where he lived ſometimes with a Juſtice of Peace, who not only entertained him courteouſly, but at his Death left him a Legacy, which was a very ſeaſonable ſupply to him who had already ſpent in a manner all he had gotten at <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> or elſewhere (which was not inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable) in now about four Years chargeable reſtraint. But he could not continue long here, before notice was given to Judg <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw,</hi> Preſident of the Council of State, who caus'd him to be recalled by his Keeper, and kept more ſtraitly. In this long Confinement, that which was moſt grievous to this Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer (devoted to the Service of Truth) was, that the Imputation of Blaſphemy and Hereſy to him, had ſo alienated all People generally from him, that he could have almoſt none to converſe with; and of the Divines, whoſe Duty it was to have endeavoured his Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, not one (that I could ever hereof) vouchſafed him a Viſit in that ſeven Years time of his Confinement, except perhaps one Mr. <hi>Gunning,</hi> afterward Biſhop of <hi>Ely.</hi> Here he ſpent even all his Subſtance, inſomuch that inſtead of an Ordinary for repaſt which he could not pay for, he was glad of the cheaper ſupport of drinking a draught of Milk from the Cow Morning and Evening. At length it pleaſed the Divine Goodneſs to ſuccour him through the favour of a Learned Man, who commended him to <hi>Roger Daniel</hi> the Printer, for a Man qualified with fit Learning and Integrity for correcting of the Impreſſion of the Septuagint Greek Bible, which was then deſigned to be ſet forth with great Accuracy, and was accordingly performed the Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being alſo moſt acceptable to <hi>J. Bidle,</hi> becauſe his delight was in the Law of God.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1651, was promulgated by the Parliament a general Act of Oblivion, which reſtored among others our conſcientious Priſoner to his full Liberty, which he now improves among thoſe Friends he had at length gained in <hi>London,</hi> in meeting together every Lord's-day for expounding Scripture, and diſcourſing thereupon, for the clearing of the Truths therein contained, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting of common Errors; by which means the Doctrine of one God, and Chriſt his only Son, and his Holy Spirit, was ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated, that the Miniſters at <hi>London</hi> were exceedingly offended at it, but could not hinder it by Secular Power, which then favour'd Liberty of Religion and Conſcience. In the Year 1654, he publiſh'd a twofold Scripture-Catechiſm. In the ſame Year Dr. <hi>Gunning</hi> (whom I named before) after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Regius Profeſſor</hi> of Divinity at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg,</hi> and no leſs famous for Subtilty of diſputing than Learning, thinking (it ſeems) he ſhould do great Service to the common Doctrine, if he put a Baffle upon the great Oppugner of it, before even thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to hearken to him; he came one Lord's-day to Mr. <hi>Bidle</hi>'s Meeting, well accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with learned Witneſſes, and commences a fair Scholaſtick Diſpute, aſſerting the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Holy Ghoſt; and the next Lord's-day in the ſame Auditory concerning the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Deity of Chriſt, the Son of the moſt High. They diſputed ſyllogiſtically,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:132760:4"/>
and took their turns of reſponding and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, wherein <hi>John Bidle</hi> acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſo much Learning, Judgment and Knowledg in the ſenſe of Holy Scriptures, that inſtead of loſing, he gained much Credit both to himſelf and his Cauſe, as even the Gentlemen of Dr. <hi>Gunning</hi>'s Party, ſome of them had the ingenuity to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. After this Dr. <hi>Gunning</hi> comes again at unawares, and hears <hi>J. Biddle</hi> arguing againſt the Satisfaction of Punitive Juſtice by the Death of Chriſt, which the Doctor with great vigour defends; but found the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent no leſs skilful and dextrous in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict than in the former, which the Doctor himſelf had the Generoſity afterward to confeſs.</p>
            <p>In <hi>December</hi> following he was brought to the Bar of the Commons Houſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conveen'd by <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and there asked, If he was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that <hi>Two-fold Scripture Catechiſm,</hi> (wherein all the Queſtions are anſwered in the words of Scripture at large)? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by asking, Whether it ſeem'd reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that one brought before a Judgment-Seat as a Criminal, ſhould accuſe himſelf? And they preſently committed him a cloſe Priſoner to the <hi>Gatehouſe, Decemb.</hi> 3. prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him the uſe of Pen, Ink, and Paper, or the acceſs of any Viſitant; and commanded his Books to be burnt by the common Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. In this caſe nothing leſs than capital Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment could be expected; which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the Priſoner bare a compoſed and chearful Mind, hoping in God, whoſe Cauſe he ſuffer'd for, for a happy Event. Neither did this Hope deceive him, for the Protector, for Reaſons of his own Intereſt, diſſolv'd that Parliament: and the Priſoner, after about ſix Months Impriſonment, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd his Liberty at the Court of the <hi>Kings,</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Bench, May</hi> 28. by due Courſe of Law; Neither was he any whit diſcouraged by theſe Dangers and Sufferings, but betook himſelf to his former Exerciſes for propagat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Truth, and the Honour of Almighty God concern'd therein.</p>
            <p>But ſcarce a Year was expired, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother no leſs formidable Danger overtook him, which was thus: There was a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable number of a Congregation of thoſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> who began to entertain <hi>J. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi>'s Sentiments concerning the Trinity. The Paſtor, one <hi>Griffin,</hi> thinking (it ſhould ſeem) to reduce them to their former Opinion, and to put a ſtop to the ſpreading of this Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green, (as he eſteemed it) challenges Mr. <hi>Bidle</hi> to a publick Diſputation, at his Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, upon the Subject of Chriſt's Supream Deity; which he would have declin'd, as knowing Mr. <hi>Griffin</hi> to be far inferior to him in Learning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but at length he accepted it: And being met in the midſt of a numerous Auditory, among whom not a few of <hi>J. Bidle</hi>'s inveterate and fiery Adverſaries, eſpecially ſome Bookſellers: Mr. <hi>Griffin,</hi> either imprudently, or to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the Hearers againſt his Antagoniſt, or for ſome worſe End, repeating the Queſtion, asks, If any Man there did deny, that Chriſt was God moſt High? To which our <hi>Bidle</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and conſcientiouſly anſwers, <hi>I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it:</hi> By which generous Profeſſion, he gave his Adverſaries occaſion of a poſitive and clear Accuſation, which they ſoon laid hold of. For though <hi>John Griffin</hi> was not (in the Judgment of all Judicious Hearers) able to cope with <hi>John Bidle,</hi> yet he had the confidence to conſent to another Meeting, when <hi>J. Bidle</hi> ſhould take his turn of proving the Negative of the Queſtion between them. But before that Day came, he was caſt into the Priſon, firſt of the <hi>Compter,</hi> then of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, London,</hi> July 3. 1655. and tried for his Life the next Seſſions, upon that obſolete and abrogated Ordinance, againſt Blaſphemy and Hereſy, of <hi>May</hi> 2. 1648. mention'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. To the Indictment hereupon, he prays Counſel might be allow'd him to plead the illegality of it; Which being denied him by the Judges, and the Sentence of a Mute threatned, he at length gave into Court his Exceptions ingroſſed in Parchment; and with much ſtrugling, had Counſel allow'd him; but the Trial was deferr'd to the next Day. But the Protector well knowing it was not for the Intereſt of his Government, either to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:132760:5"/>
have him Condemn'd or Abſolv'd, takes him out of the Hands of the Law, and ſends him away to the Iſle of <hi>Scilly, Octob.</hi> 5. 1655. For, on the one Hand, the Presbyterians, and all Enemies to Liberty of Religion, (of which there appear'd a great number at his Trial) would be offended at his Releaſe; and all that were for Liberty, (among whom many Congregations of <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> eſpecially) had petition'd the Protector for his diſcharge from proſecution upon that Ordinance, by which all their Liberties were threatned and condemned, and the Capital Article of the Protector's Government infringed; which run thus, <hi>That ſuch as profeſs Faith in God by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, (though differing in Judgment from the Doctrine, Worſhip, or Diſcipline publickly held forth) ſhall not be reſtrained from, but ſhall he protected,</hi> &amp;c. Art. 37. <hi>That all Laws, Statutes, Ordinances,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to the contrary of the aforeſaid Liberty, ſhall be eſteemed as Null and Void,</hi> Art. 38.</p>
            <p>Now although this Baniſhment drew with it many Inconveniences, yet through the Goodneſs of God it was temper'd with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Here the Priſoner enjoy'd much Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Comfort from the Heavenly Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations, which his Retirement gave him opportunity for: Here he had ſweet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Father, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and attained a clearer Underſtanding of the Divine Oracles in many particulars. Here, whilſt he was more abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in the Doctrines of his Confeſſion of Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet he ſeems notwithſtanding to have become more doubtful about ſome other Points, which he had formerly held, as appears from his <hi>Eſſay to the Explaining of the Revelation,</hi> which he wrote after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thence: which ſhews that he ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a free and unprejudiced Mind. And here we muſt not forget to do the Protector this right, as to tell the World, that after ſome time he was pleaſed to allow his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner a Hundred Crowns <hi>per Annum</hi> for his ſubſiſtance, to wit, leſt being removed far from his Friends and Imployments, he ſhould want Neceſſaries. This Baniſhment ſeems alſo to have been beneficial to him on this Account, that it was a means to prevent another of the Protector's Parliaments from decreeing any thing more rigid againſt him; being now abſent and out of their way. In this Exile he continued about three Years, notwithſtanding all Endeavours of his Friends for his Liberty; and his own Letters, both to the Protector and to Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> (an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Presbyterian Miniſter) to reaſon them into compaſſion. At length, through the Importunity of Friends, and other Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, the Protector ſuffer'd a Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to be granted out of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Bench Court</hi> (as it was then called) and to be obeyed by the Governour of <hi>Scilly,</hi> whereby the Priſoner was brought thence, and by that Court ſet at liberty, as finding no legal Cauſe of detaining him.</p>
            <p>And now, notwithſtanding all theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, Sufferings and Dangers he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto underwent, he was not terrified, from what he counted his Duty to Chriſt, in propagating the true knowledg of the only true God, and of Jeſus Chriſt whom he had ſent, but return'd to his long inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Exerciſes among his Friends. But he could not long labour in this Field, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five Months after, the Protector <hi>Oliver</hi> dies, and his Son <hi>Richard</hi> ſucceeding, calls a Parliament, dangerous certainly to <hi>John Bidle</hi> in the firſt place, if to any other; which being foreſeen, he was forced as it were, (for he did it with regret,) by the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of a Noble Friend, to retire into the Country during their Seſſion. But that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament being diſſolv'd, he returned to his wonted Station, till ſuch time as the Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons between the Protector and Army had brought into Power again the Long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the Diviſions of that Parliament, and Army, and People, had brought in General <hi>Monk</hi> out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he the Seclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Members, and they the Exil'd King <hi>Charles,</hi> and with him a reſtoration of the Antient Government in Church and State. Then after ſome time the liberty of Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Worſhippers was taken away, and their Meetings puniſh'd as ſeditious. Now <hi>J. Bidle</hi> yields to the Time, and reſtrains him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:132760:5"/>
from publick to more private Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. But neither could he long enjoy thoſe, however peaceable and harmleſs, for on the firſt of <hi>June,</hi> 1662. He was haled out of his Lodgings, where he was conven'd with ſome few of his Friends for Divine Worſhip, and carried before Sir <hi>Rich. Brown,</hi> who forthwith committed them all to the publick Priſon; <hi>J. Bidle</hi> to the Dungeon, where he lay for five hours, and was denied the benefit of the Law, which admits Offenders of that ſort to Bail for their Appearance. There they lay till the Recorder, moved with more reverence of the Laws, took ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for their anſwering to their Charge next Seſſions; which they perform'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. But when the Court could not find any Statute whereon to form any Criminal Indictment againſt them, they were referr'd to the Seſſions following; and then were proceeded againſt, by pretext of an Offence againſt Common Law, (the Rules of which lie moſtly in the Judges Breaſts) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon fined every one of the Hearers in the penalty of Twenty Pounds, and <hi>J. Bidle</hi> in One Hundred; to lie in Priſon till paid. Now though the Sheriff would generouſly have been ſatisfied with Ten Pounds for him, and he would have paid it, yet the Enmity of Sir <hi>Rich. Brown</hi> was ſuch, as he could not be induced to conſent thereto up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any terms; but threatn'd him with a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Years Impriſonment, though he ſhould pay the whole Hundred Pounds; This was the cauſe of his continuing in Priſon; but he had not been there full five Weeks, till by reaſon of the noiſomneſs of the Place and pent Air, to him, whoſe only Recreation and Exerciſe had been, for many Years, to walk daily into the free Air, he contracted a Diſeaſe, which in a few days, alas, put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to his Life. In this Extremity Sir <hi>R. Brown</hi> could not be moved to grant the Sick Priſoner the preſent Comfort of a Removal, in order to a Recovery; but Sheriff <hi>Meynel,</hi> to the praiſe of his great Humanity, did grant it: But, alas, the ſecond Day after his removal, between five and ſix a Clock in the Morning, the 22th of <hi>September</hi> 1662. he quietly gave up his Spirit to God. He was then in the ſtrength of his Age, the 47th Year of his Life. Now it did appear, (as he had ſaid formerly) that by frequent Meditations of the Reſurrection and future Happineſs, he had made Death contemptible to himſelf. For as ſoon, as by the Diſeaſe more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly annoying his Brain, he perceiv'd a great Alteration, he ſignified it to his Friends, and would not be induced to any Diſcourſe, but compos'd himſelf as it were to ſleep, during that eight hours time, which after that he liv'd, being very ſparing of Words, or indeed of Groans, that might argue any Impatience; notwithſtanding, when a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pious Matron, who miniſtred to him, broke forth into this (as it were) Farewel-ſaying, <hi>God grant we may ſee one another in the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> He, now his Speech failing, left up his quivering Hand, ſhewing thereby (it ſeems) how pleaſing that Wiſh was to him. And that he was not ſurpriz'd with dying at this time, may be collected from his often ſaying before, That if he ſhould be once more caſt into Priſon, he ſhould never be reſtor'd to Liberty; and moreover, <hi>That the Work was done,</hi> meaning, That that Truth which God had rais'd him up to profeſs, was ſufficiently brought to light, there wanted only Ingenuity in Men, for the embracing and acknowledging it.</p>
            <p>Having in this manner deſcribed the Courſe of <hi>John Bidle</hi>'s Life, it may perhaps be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, why being ſo learned and able a Man, he publiſhed ſo few Books, eſpecially being provoked by divers Anſwers to what he did publiſh, to which he did not reply? To this it may be anſwered, firſt, That he was verily perſwaded, that Truth being in it ſelf plain and ſimple, eſpecially what is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and very uſeful, is eaſy to be apprehended by few words; it's Error that ſeeks Garniſh in many Words and Figures of Speech. Again, what he did publiſh, he well deliberated of; ſo that he did not find in the adverſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, any thing of moment, which an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Reader might not perceive already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated: And they that attend not to the firſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:132760:6"/>
Propoſitions, will not receive benefit by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies and Rejoinders. We add, that he treading in a Path, long over-grown with Briars and Thorns of Error and Sophiſtry, it requir'd vaſtly greater Labour and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to find out the Way of Truth, in which no Engliſh-Man had by any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing Foot-ſteeps gone before him for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages.</p>
            <p>But that which in my Judgment does more commend our <hi>John Bidle,</hi> than all his Labours and Sufferings for the propagation of great and important Truths, is his great Zeal for promoting Holineſs of Life and Manners; for this was always his End and Deſign in what he taught. He valued not his Doctrines for Speculation but Practice; inſomuch that he would not diſcourſe of thoſe Points wherein he differed from others, with thoſe that appear'd not religious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Knowledg. Neither could he bear thoſe that diſſembled in Profeſſion for Worldly Intereſts. He was a ſtrict Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver himſelf, and a ſevere Exactor in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of reverence in ſpeaking of God, and Chriſt, and Holy Things; ſo that he would by no means hear their Names, or any Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Holy Scripture us'd vainly or light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, much leſs any fooliſh Talking, or Scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. He would often tell his Friends, that no Religion would benefit a bad Man; and call upon them to reſolve with themſelves, as well to profeſs and practiſe the Truth that is according to Godlineſs, as to ſtudy to find it out; and that againſt all Terrors or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements to the contrary; being aſſured that nothing diſpleaſing to Almighty God, could be in any wiſe profitable to them. But as for thoſe that were really of a contrary Mind to him, how mean ſoever, (for he was very humble and condeſcending) they could not oblige him more, than by pertinent Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſoberly urg'd, to give him the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of reſolving them; which he always did with great ſimplicity and plainneſs of Speech, without any oſtentation of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which yet he was as much maſter of, as thoſe moſt famous on that Account. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his Learning in Matters of Religion was gain'd by a diligent ſtudy of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, eſpecially of the New Teſtament, wherein he was ſo converſant, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd it all in his Memory <hi>verbatim,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Engliſh, but in Greek, as far as the Fourth Chapter of <hi>the Revelation of St. John.</hi> This thorow-knowledg in the Scriptures, join'd with an ordinary, happy, and ready Memory, whereby he retain'd alſo the Sum of what he had read in other Authors, gave him great advantage againſt all Opponents, and in all Diſcourſes, but without the leaſt appearance of boaſting.</p>
            <p>I could mention many other things, which ſhew that it was in his Heart to promote Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and that he had no deſign of aggrandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing his Name by oppoſition to common Doctrins. Indeed, he was a great Aſſerter of common Doctrines againſt Noval Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that tended either to Sedition, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniſm, or Superſtition. And in what he held contrary to the Current, he did not endeavour to tie thoſe he had won, to be of his Mind in ſuch a Society, and by ſuch a Society, and by ſuch bands, as might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue them a ſucceſſive Party, bearing his Name as their Founder, but left them at all that liberty, which the Duty of owning the Truth according to their Conſcience, and of mutual edification, would allow them. And as no tincture of Ambition did appear in him, ſo neither of the leaſt degree of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting worldly Gain: for he always ſuſtain'd himſelf by his own Induſtry, when he was in capacity of uſing it; and would never accept of any Supplies, tho offer'd; but when his Neceſſities, ariſing from Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, Sickneſs, or the like, forc'd him to it, (Except that after his ſeven Years re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, a friendly Citizen of <hi>London</hi> impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd him to take a Bed and Board with him; and after his Deliverance from <hi>Scilly</hi> another did the like) for he had learn'd to be contented with a little, and ſought not more, yea out of that little would contribute to the Neceſſities of others. Temperance was at all times moſt conſpicuous in him, as well in eating as in drinking: and he thought it not enough to be very chaſt, but that he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:132760:6"/>
ought to avoid all ſuſpicion of unchaſtity; inſomuch that he would not willingly look upon a Woman without juſt occaſion; and was very uneaſy, if left in a room with one alone, till reliev'd by more Company.</p>
            <p>I have ſpoken above of the Reverence and Gravity he us'd himſelf, and exacted of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in handling of Holy Things; in other matters he would be merry and pleaſant, and liked well that the Company ſhould be ſo too; yet even in this common Converſe, he always retain'd an awe of the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and was ſometimes obſerv'd to lift up his Hand ſuddenly; which thoſe that were intimate with him, knew to be an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a ſecret Ejaculation. But in his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-Devotions, he was wont often to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate himſelf upon the Ground, after the manner of our Saviour in his Agony, and would commend that Poſture of Worſhip al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to his moſt intimate Friends. But his Devotion toward God, and ſtudy for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating Divine Truth, did not, as in ſome Perſons, ſwallow up his Juſtice and Charity toward Men, for he was as careful a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſer and promoter of thoſe Virtues, as his Opinion of their Neceſſity to Salvation did require.</p>
            <p>In fine, many more things might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, which might demonſtrate <hi>John Bidle,</hi> to have been a Man, if any in this laſt Age, moſt eminent for Piety and Virtue, as well as Learning and Knowledg. But thus much at leaſt was due to his Memory, not only to vindicate him from thoſe Depraved Affections that encline Men to Hereſy, and to be the Authors of new Sects: but to give the World an Example of a ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former.</p>

For that this only is the Matter in Conteſtation, you very well know, having both heard my Confeſſion before the Committee, and remembring how, when I was urged to declare my Judgment concerning the Deity of Chriſt, I waved the Queſtion, as neither being that I was accuſed of, nor which I had yet ſufficiently ſtudied, to engage my ſelf publickly therein.

Howbeit when he, the Spirit of Truth, is come, he will guide you into all Truth; for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf; but whatſoever he ſhall hear, that ſhall he ſpeak; and he ſhall ſhew you things to come. He ſhall glorify me; for he ſhall receive of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you.

And they ſaid unto him, We have not ſo much as heard whether there be any Holy Spirit.]</hi> Epheſ. 4.4, 5, 6. <hi>There is one Body, and one Spirit, even as ye have been called in one Hope of your Calling. One Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm. One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.]</hi> 1 Cor. 12.3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.

The Scripture is wont to ſpeak more ſoberly of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, than to ſay that he is given by another, much leſs by Men, as it is here ſaid of the Holy Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4. <hi>We know that an Idol is nothing in the World, and that there is no other God but one. For though there be that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods, whether in Heaven or in Earth; as there be many Gods, and many Lords, yet unto us there is but one God, even the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, even Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by him.]</hi> You ſee here, that the Apoſtle being about to ſet down, who is the only God, and only Lord of Chriſtians, maketh no mention of the Holy Spirit; which could not have been done by ſo faithful an Apoſtle, had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit been either God or Lord.

            <p>Behold now the Cauſe for which I have lien under Perſecution, raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me by my Adverſaries; who being unable to juſtify by Argument their Practice of giving Glory to the Holy Spirit, as God, in the end of their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſince there is neither Precept nor Example for it in all the Scripture; and being taxed by me for giving the Glory of God to another, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping what he hath not commanded, nor ever came into his Heart, have, in a cruel and unchriſtian manner, reſorted to the Arm of Fleſh, and inſtigated the Magiſtrate againſt me, hoping by his Sword, (not that of the Spirit) to uphold their Will-worſhip; but in vain, ſince every Plant that the Heavenly Father hath not ſet, ſhall be rooted up. And that this practice of Worſhipping the Holy Spirit as God, is ſuch a Plant as God never ſet in his Word, would

ſoon appear to the Honourable Houſe, could they be but ſo far prevailed with, as, laying aſide all Prejudice, ſeriouſly to weigh the many and ſolid Proofs that I produce for my Opinion out of the Scripture, together with the ſlight, or rather no Proofs of the adverſe Party for their Opinion; which they themſelves know not what to make of, but that they endeavour to delude both themſelves and others with Perſonalities, Moods, Subſiſtences, and ſuch like brain-ſick Notions, that have neither ſap nor ſence in them, and were firſt hatched by the ſubtility of Satan in the Heads of Platoniſts, to pervert the Worſhip of the True God. Neither could this Controverſy be ſet on foot in a fitter juncture of time than this; wherein the Parliament and Kingdom have ſolemnly engaged themſelves to reform Religion, both in Diſcipline and Doctrine. For amongſt all the Corruptions in Doctrine, which certainly are many, there is none that more deſerveth to be amended than this, that ſo palpably thwarteth the whole tenour of the Scripture, and trencheth to the very Object of our Worſhip, and therefore ought not to be lightly paſſed over by any Man that profeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Chriſtian, much more a Reformer. God is jealous of his Honour, and will not give it to another; we therefore, as beloved Children, ſhould imitate our Heavenly Father herein, and not upon any pretence whatſoever depart from his expreſs Command, and give the Worſhip of the ſupreme Lord of Heaven and Earth, to him whom the Scripture no-where affirmeth to be God. For my own particular, after a long impartial inquiry of the Truth, in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, and after much and earneſt calling upon God, to give unto me the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation in the knowledg of him; I find my ſelf obliged, both by the Principles of Scripture and of Reaſon, to embrace the Opinion I now hold forth; and as much as in me lieth, to endeavour that the Honour of Almighty God be not transferred to another, not only to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of God himſelf, but alſo of his Holy Spirit, who cannot but be grieved to have that ignorantly aſcribed to himſelf, which is proper to God that ſends him, and which he no-where challengeth to himſelf in the Scripture. What ſhall befal me in the purſuance of this Work, I refer to the diſpoſal of the all-wiſe God, whoſe Glory is dearer to me, not only than my Liberty, but than my Life. It will be your part, Honoured Sir, into whoſe hands God hath put ſuch an Opportunity, to examine the Buſineſs impartially, and to be an helper to the Truth, conſidering that this Controverſy is of the greateſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the World, and that the Divine Truth ſuffers her ſelf not to be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Scot-free. Neither let the meanneſs of my outward preſence deter you from ſtirring, ſince it is the part of a wiſe Man, as in all things, ſo eſpecially in Matters of Religion, not to regard ſo much who it is that ſpeaketh, as what it is that is ſpoken; remembring how our Saviour in the Goſpel ſaith, That God

is wont to hide his Secrets from the Wiſe and Prudent, and to reveal them unto Children. In which number I willingly reckon my ſelf, being conſcious of mine own perſonal Weakneſs, but well aſſured of the Strength and Evidence of the Scripture to bear me out in this Cauſe; and remain</p>
