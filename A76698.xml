            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE intelligent and ≈øearching Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, finding in this Book, under the Title of <hi>The Apo≈øtolical and true Opinion, concerning the Holy Trinity, Revived and A≈ø≈øerted,</hi> &amp;c. ≈øeveral Explications of Holy Scripture, and Te≈øtimonies out of the mo≈øt ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian Writers, touching that great and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous Doctrine, much differing from the commonly-receiv'd Opinions of both Papi≈øts and Prote≈øtants of the≈øe later Ages, will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, be de≈øirous to know ≈øomething of the Author's Life and Qualifications. Let him plea≈øe therefore to take this plain and ≈øhort Account, without tho≈øe Embelli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which the Lives of eminent Men are de≈øervedly adorned with, but which my A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities will not reach to.</p>
            <p>Know then, that the Author, <hi>John Bidle,</hi> was born at <hi>Wotton-under-hedg,</hi> in the County of <hi>Glouce≈øter,</hi> in the Year of our Lord Chri≈øt, 1615. His Father, <hi>Edward Bidle,</hi> was of a middle ≈øort of Yeomen, and al≈øo dealt in Woollen Clothes; by which means he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his Family hone≈øtly, and with credit ≈øuitable to his Rank, or rather above it. His
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:132760:3"/>
Son <hi>John,</hi> our Author, was educated in the Free-School of that Town; where his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in the Learning there taught, was ≈øoon taken notice of, both by Neighbours, and tho≈øe more remote; among whom my Lord <hi>Barkley,</hi> as a Per≈øonage of the greate≈øt Honour, ≈øo great a lover and promoter of Learning, is in the fir≈øt place to be remembred. Who in re≈øpect to the early Blo≈ø≈øoms of a rare Wit, great Probity and Ingenuity in our young Scholar, conferr'd upon him the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of ten Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> among other the poorer Scholars; although by his Age, being not of ten Years, he was not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, according to common Method, for that Donation. And this Favour, it ≈øeems, added greater Vigour and Indu≈øtry to the Youth's Studies; for after this, he did not only with ea≈øe ≈øurpa≈øs tho≈øe his School-fellows of the ≈øame Rank, but, in Time, even out-run his In≈øtructions, and became Tutor to him≈øelf; ≈øo overcoming both the Labours of his Task, and tho≈øe Difficulties he met with in his Cour≈øe. However, the want of fit Teaching on the one hand, and the benefit of that Exhibition on the other, or perhaps the want of fit Provi≈øions for a Student in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity, detain'd him longer in that School, than was otherwi≈øe for his Improvement; for here he continued till he was about Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years of Age. In this Time he gave ≈øome Specimens of his pregnant, both Wit and Judgment, in the Tran≈ølation of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Bucolicks,</hi> and the two fir≈øt Satyrs of <hi>Juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> into elegant Engli≈øh Ver≈øe; afterward publi≈øh'd in print, with approbation of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men. He compo≈øed al≈øo, and recited, before a full Auditory, an elaborate Oration in Latin, for a gracing to the Funeral of an honourable School-fellow. Yea, even in the≈øe younger Years was ob≈øerved in him a ≈øingular piety of Mind, and contempt of ≈øecular Affairs; Whence it came, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied him≈øelf to the ≈øtudy of Vertue, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Liberal Arts; and with great diligence gave dutiful A≈ø≈øi≈øtance to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, become a Widow by the Death of his Father.</p>
            <p>From hence he was ≈øent to the Univer≈øity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and was admitted a Student in <hi>Magdalen-Hall</hi> there; where, in due time, he proceeded Ma≈øter of Arts with good ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plau≈øe, and was reckon'd among tho≈øe of his rank, that did in an e≈øpecial manner commend the Learning of that Academy. Here he did ≈øo Philo≈øophize, as it might be ob≈øerved, he was determined more by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon than Authority; however, in Divine Things he did not much di≈ø≈øent from the common Doctrine, as may be collected from a little Tract he wrote again≈øt Dancing. But the fame of his Learning and Prudence in in≈øtructing Pupils there, having conciliated to him the E≈øteem of Per≈øons of Quality, and more particularly of the Over≈øeers of the School of <hi>Wootton,</hi> he was cho≈øen by them to ≈øucceed in the Ma≈øter≈øhip thereof; which he may ≈øeem to have as wi≈øely as mode≈øtly refu≈øed, but did in the mean time commend to them, another fit Per≈øon, whom they accepted of. This refu≈øal gave oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to the Magi≈øtrates of <hi>Glouce≈øter,</hi> upon ample Recommendations of the principal Per≈øons in the Univer≈øity, to chu≈øe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune him to be Ma≈øter of the Free-School of <hi>Cri≈øps</hi> in that City; which he con≈øented to; and at his approach thither, was met and received by them with much Joy and Honour, <hi>Anno</hi> 1641. Neither did he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Expectations, nor come ≈øhort of the Character had been given of him, whil≈øt he di≈øcharged that Imployment with ≈øuch skil and faithfulne≈øs, that they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves not a little happy in that behalf, who could commit their Sons to his In≈øtruction. Whence it came to pa≈øs, that not ≈øo much by the Salary, which is not great, but by the Gratuities of Parents, he reap'd con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Profits. But Money did not infect his Mind with the love of it; his Mind was ≈øet upon the Knowledg of Divine Truth, and that, not for Curio≈øity, but for the Love of Chri≈øt, who is Truth and Life. And having laid a≈øide the Impediments of Prejudice, he gave him≈øelf liberty to try all things, that he might hold fa≈øt that which is good. Thus diligently reading the Holy Scripture, (for <hi>Socinian</hi> Books he had read
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:132760:3"/>
none) and fervently imploring Divine Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, he perceiv'd the common Doctrin concerning the Holy Trinity was not well grounded in Revelation, much le≈øs in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon. And being as generous in ≈øpeaking, as free in judging, he did, as occa≈øion offered, di≈øcover his Rea≈øons of que≈øtioning it: Which ≈øome Zealots not being able to bear, they accus'd him to the Magi≈øtrates of Here≈øy in that Point, before whom he exhibited in Writing this Confe≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 2, 1644.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I believe there is but one Infinite and Almighty E≈ø≈øence, called God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I believe, that as there is but one Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and Almighty E≈ø≈øence, ≈øo there is but one Per≈øon in that E≈ø≈øence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I believe that our Saviour Je≈øus Chri≈øt is truly God, by being truly, really and properly united to the only Per≈øon of the Infinite and Almighty E≈ø≈øence.</p>
            <p>But when this did not ≈øatisfy the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrates, but they did ≈øtill pre≈øs upon him to acknowledg three Per≈øons in the Divine E≈ø≈øence, and he, it ≈øeems, knowing that the word Per≈øons, when a≈øcribed to God, is taken both by the Ancient Fathers, and by Modern Writers in various Significations, did, about fourteen days after, confe≈øs that that there are three in that one Divine E≈ø≈øence commonly termed Per≈øons.</p>
            <p>By this it appears, that how di≈øtinct ≈øoever he might be in his Conceptions concerning the Trinity, yet he was not determinate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in his expre≈ø≈øing of that matter, as he became not long after. For now proceeding ≈øincerely in his ≈øearch of holy Scripture, and in earne≈øt Prayer to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God for his A≈ø≈øi≈øtance, he attained that firmne≈øs of Under≈øtanding and Re≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that di≈øtinctne≈øs of Expre≈ø≈øion, that he ≈øet him≈øelf to confer with his Familiars, and open his Mind freely upon tho≈øe Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtions of one God, and three Per≈øons. And not only ≈øo, but he al≈øo wrote ≈øome pithy Arguments again≈øt the ≈øuppo≈øed Deity of the Holy Spirit, whom yet he held to be the third Per≈øon in the Holy Trinity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a certain unfaithful Per≈øon betraying him to the Magi≈øtrate, and the Commi≈ø≈øioners of Parliament there re≈øiding, (for then was there War between the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) he was committed <hi>Dec.</hi> 2. 1645, to the common Goal (tho at that time afflicted with a ≈øore Fever) there to be detained till a fit occa≈øion of pre≈øenting him before the Parliament at <hi>London</hi> (which was then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with <hi>Geneva</hi>-Zeal again≈øt ≈øuch Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks) to be puni≈øhed as they ≈øhould deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. But now an eminent Per≈øon of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øter</hi> commi≈øerating his Ca≈øe, procured his Inlargemert upon Security for an Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as afore≈øaid, which Mr. <hi>Bidle</hi> made accordingly when ≈øummoned thereto, about ≈øix Months after. And the Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed not to take Cognizance of his Cau≈øe, for they pre≈øently cho≈øe a Committee to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine him; who freely confe≈øt before them, that he did deny the commonly believ'd Deity of the Holy Gho≈øt, whereof he was accus'd; but was ready to hear what could be oppos'd to him, and to acknowledg his Error, if he could not maintain it for Truth. But being wearied with no le≈øs long than chargeable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, he wrote the Letter hereafter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerted, dated <hi>April</hi> 1, 1647, to an eminent Knight, a Member of Parliament, praying he would report his Ca≈øe to their Hou≈øe, that he might be either judged or di≈øcharged. But what followed thence was the Commitment of Mr. <hi>Bidle</hi> to the Cu≈øtody of one of their Officers (which Re≈øtraint continued for five Years en≈øuing) and the referring him to the A≈ø≈øembly of the Presbyterian Divines, then ≈øitting at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> for his Conviction: Before ≈øome of which he often appear'd, and gave them in Writing his Arguments again≈øt the Deity of the Holy Spirit; but neither in Di≈øcour≈øes nor in Writing could he obtain any pertinent, much le≈øs ≈øolid An≈øwer. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead of that, they ≈øolicite the Parliament, in who≈øe hands was the ≈øupream Power at that time, and procure a Draconick Ordinance (<hi>May</hi> 2. 1648.) for inflicting the Puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Death upon tho≈øe that held Opinions contrary to the Presbyterian Points about the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:132760:4"/>
Trinity, and other Doctrines, whom they named Bla≈øphemers and Hereticks, and ≈øevere Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon tho≈øe that differ'd in le≈ø≈øer matters. This ≈øeemed a Damnatory Sentence again≈øt Mr. <hi>Bidle,</hi> which there was no e≈øcape from. But it plea≈øed the Almighty to make way for him, by a Di≈ø≈øention in the Parliament it ≈øelf; to the better part whereof the Army joyn'd its Power, as for other Rea≈øons, ≈øo for that there were in it many both Officers and Souldiers, liable to the Severities of that mention'd Ordinance, which therefore from that time for divers Years lay unregarded.</p>
            <p>Before this he had publi≈øhed the <hi>Twelve Arguments again≈øt the Deity of the Holy Spirit,</hi> and this Year his Confe≈ø≈øion of Faith touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Trinity, which were both Reprinted, <hi>Anno</hi> 1653. together with mo≈øt clear and full Te≈øtimonies for the Unity of the Per≈øon of God in di≈øtinction from the Son and Spirit, out of certain mo≈øt celebrated Chri≈øtian Fathers, who lived in the fir≈øt Ages after Chri≈øt, and others. Now the Zealots in Parliament again≈øt Di≈ø≈øenters being exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he had more liberty allow'd by his Keeper, who ≈øuffered him upon Security given to go into <hi>Stafford≈øhire,</hi> where he lived ≈øometimes with a Ju≈øtice of Peace, who not only entertained him courteou≈øly, but at his Death left him a Legacy, which was a very ≈øea≈øonable ≈øupply to him who had already ≈øpent in a manner all he had gotten at <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øter,</hi> or el≈øewhere (which was not incon≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable) in now about four Years chargeable re≈øtraint. But he could not continue long here, before notice was given to Judg <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhaw,</hi> Pre≈øident of the Council of State, who caus'd him to be recalled by his Keeper, and kept more ≈øtraitly. In this long Confinement, that which was mo≈øt grievous to this Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer (devoted to the Service of Truth) was, that the Imputation of Bla≈øphemy and Here≈øy to him, had ≈øo alienated all People generally from him, that he could have almo≈øt none to conver≈øe with; and of the Divines, who≈øe Duty it was to have endeavoured his Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, not one (that I could ever hereof) vouch≈øafed him a Vi≈øit in that ≈øeven Years time of his Confinement, except perhaps one Mr. <hi>Gunning,</hi> afterward Bi≈øhop of <hi>Ely.</hi> Here he ≈øpent even all his Sub≈øtance, in≈øomuch that in≈øtead of an Ordinary for repa≈øt which he could not pay for, he was glad of the cheaper ≈øupport of drinking a draught of Milk from the Cow Morning and Evening. At length it plea≈øed the Divine Goodne≈øs to ≈øuccour him through the favour of a Learned Man, who commended him to <hi>Roger Daniel</hi> the Printer, for a Man qualified with fit Learning and Integrity for correcting of the Impre≈ø≈øion of the Septuagint Greek Bible, which was then de≈øigned to be ≈øet forth with great Accuracy, and was accordingly performed the Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being al≈øo mo≈øt acceptable to <hi>J. Bidle,</hi> becau≈øe his delight was in the Law of God.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1651, was promulgated by the Parliament a general Act of Oblivion, which re≈øtored among others our con≈øcientious Pri≈øoner to his full Liberty, which he now improves among tho≈øe Friends he had at length gained in <hi>London,</hi> in meeting together every Lord's-day for expounding Scripture, and di≈øcour≈øing thereupon, for the clearing of the Truths therein contained, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting of common Errors; by which means the Doctrine of one God, and Chri≈øt his only Son, and his Holy Spirit, was ≈øo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated, that the Mini≈øters at <hi>London</hi> were exceedingly offended at it, but could not hinder it by Secular Power, which then favour'd Liberty of Religion and Con≈øcience. In the Year 1654, he publi≈øh'd a twofold Scripture-Catechi≈øm. In the ≈øame Year Dr. <hi>Gunning</hi> (whom I named before) after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Regius Profe≈ø≈øor</hi> of Divinity at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg,</hi> and no le≈øs famous for Subtilty of di≈øputing than Learning, thinking (it ≈øeems) he ≈øhould do great Service to the common Doctrine, if he put a Baffle upon the great Oppugner of it, before even tho≈øe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to hearken to him; he came one Lord's-day to Mr. <hi>Bidle</hi>'s Meeting, well accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with learned Witne≈ø≈øes, and commences a fair Schola≈øtick Di≈øpute, a≈ø≈øerting the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Holy Gho≈øt; and the next Lord's-day in the ≈øame Auditory concerning the ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Deity of Chri≈øt, the Son of the mo≈øt High. They di≈øputed ≈øyllogi≈øtically,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:132760:4"/>
and took their turns of re≈øponding and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing, wherein <hi>John Bidle</hi> acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf with ≈øo much Learning, Judgment and Knowledg in the ≈øen≈øe of Holy Scriptures, that in≈øtead of lo≈øing, he gained much Credit both to him≈øelf and his Cau≈øe, as even the Gentlemen of Dr. <hi>Gunning</hi>'s Party, ≈øome of them had the ingenuity to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. After this Dr. <hi>Gunning</hi> comes again at unawares, and hears <hi>J. Biddle</hi> arguing again≈øt the Satisfaction of Punitive Ju≈øtice by the Death of Chri≈øt, which the Doctor with great vigour defends; but found the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent no le≈øs skilful and dextrous in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict than in the former, which the Doctor him≈øelf had the Genero≈øity afterward to confe≈øs.</p>
            <p>In <hi>December</hi> following he was brought to the Bar of the Commons Hou≈øe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conveen'd by <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and there asked, If he was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that <hi>Two-fold Scripture Catechi≈øm,</hi> (wherein all the Que≈øtions are an≈øwered in the words of Scripture at large)? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered by asking, Whether it ≈øeem'd rea≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that one brought before a Judgment-Seat as a Criminal, ≈øhould accu≈øe him≈øelf? And they pre≈øently committed him a clo≈øe Pri≈øoner to the <hi>Gatehou≈øe, Decemb.</hi> 3. prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him the u≈øe of Pen, Ink, and Paper, or the acce≈øs of any Vi≈øitant; and commanded his Books to be burnt by the common Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. In this ca≈øe nothing le≈øs than capital Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment could be expected; which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding, the Pri≈øoner bare a compo≈øed and chearful Mind, hoping in God, who≈øe Cau≈øe he ≈øuffer'd for, for a happy Event. Neither did this Hope deceive him, for the Protector, for Rea≈øons of his own Intere≈øt, di≈ø≈øolv'd that Parliament: and the Pri≈øoner, after about ≈øix Months Impri≈øonment, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd his Liberty at the Court of the <hi>Kings,</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>pper Bench, May</hi> 28. by due Cour≈øe of Law; Neither was he any whit di≈øcouraged by the≈øe Dangers and Sufferings, but betook him≈øelf to his former Exerci≈øes for propagat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Truth, and the Honour of Almighty God concern'd therein.</p>
            <p>But ≈øcarce a Year was expired, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother no le≈øs formidable Danger overtook him, which was thus: There was a con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable number of a Congregation of tho≈øe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Anabapti≈øts,</hi> who began to entertain <hi>J. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi>'s Sentiments concerning the Trinity. The Pa≈øtor, one <hi>Griffin,</hi> thinking (it ≈øhould ≈øeem) to reduce them to their former Opinion, and to put a ≈øtop to the ≈øpreading of this Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green, (as he e≈øteemed it) challenges Mr. <hi>Bidle</hi> to a publick Di≈øputation, at his Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, upon the Subject of Chri≈øt's Supream Deity; which he would have declin'd, as knowing Mr. <hi>Griffin</hi> to be far inferior to him in Learning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but at length he accepted it: And being met in the mid≈øt of a numerous Auditory, among whom not a few of <hi>J. Bidle</hi>'s inveterate and fiery Adver≈øaries, e≈øpecially ≈øome Book≈øellers: Mr. <hi>Griffin,</hi> either imprudently, or to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the Hearers again≈øt his Antagoni≈øt, or for ≈øome wor≈øe End, repeating the Que≈øtion, asks, If any Man there did deny, that Chri≈øt was God mo≈øt High? To which our <hi>Bidle</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolutely and con≈øcientiou≈øly an≈øwers, <hi>I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it:</hi> By which generous Profe≈ø≈øion, he gave his Adver≈øaries occa≈øion of a po≈øitive and clear Accu≈øation, which they ≈øoon laid hold of. For though <hi>John Griffin</hi> was not (in the Judgment of all Judicious Hearers) able to cope with <hi>John Bidle,</hi> yet he had the confidence to con≈øent to another Meeting, when <hi>J. Bidle</hi> ≈øhould take his turn of proving the Negative of the Que≈øtion between them. But before that Day came, he was ca≈øt into the Pri≈øon, fir≈øt of the <hi>Compter,</hi> then of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, London,</hi> July 3. 1655. and tried for his Life the next Se≈ø≈øions, upon that ob≈øolete and abrogated Ordinance, again≈øt Bla≈øphemy and Here≈øy, of <hi>May</hi> 2. 1648. mention'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. To the Indictment hereupon, he prays Coun≈øel might be allow'd him to plead the illegality of it; Which being denied him by the Judges, and the Sentence of a Mute threatned, he at length gave into Court his Exceptions ingro≈ø≈øed in Parchment; and with much ≈øtrugling, had Coun≈øel allow'd him; but the Trial was deferr'd to the next Day. But the Protector well knowing it was not for the Intere≈øt of his Government, either to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:132760:5"/>
have him Condemn'd or Ab≈øolv'd, takes him out of the Hands of the Law, and ≈øends him away to the I≈øle of <hi>Scilly, Octob.</hi> 5. 1655. For, on the one Hand, the Presbyterians, and all Enemies to Liberty of Religion, (of which there appear'd a great number at his Trial) would be offended at his Relea≈øe; and all that were for Liberty, (among whom many Congregations of <hi>Anabapti≈øts</hi> e≈øpecially) had petition'd the Protector for his di≈øcharge from pro≈øecution upon that Ordinance, by which all their Liberties were threatned and condemned, and the Capital Article of the Protector's Government infringed; which run thus, <hi>That ≈øuch as profe≈øs Faith in God by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt, (though differing in Judgment from the Doctrine, Wor≈øhip, or Di≈øcipline publickly held forth) ≈øhall not be re≈øtrained from, but ≈øhall he protected,</hi> &amp;c. Art. 37. <hi>That all Laws, Statutes, Ordinances,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to the contrary of the afore≈øaid Liberty, ≈øhall be e≈øteemed as Null and Void,</hi> Art. 38.</p>
            <p>Now although this Bani≈øhment drew with it many Inconveniences, yet through the Goodne≈øs of God it was temper'd with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Here the Pri≈øoner enjoy'd much Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Comfort from the Heavenly Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations, which his Retirement gave him opportunity for: Here he had ≈øweet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Father, and his Son Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and attained a clearer Under≈øtanding of the Divine Oracles in many particulars. Here, whil≈øt he was more abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in the Doctrines of his Confe≈ø≈øion of Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet he ≈øeems notwith≈øtanding to have become more doubtful about ≈øome other Points, which he had formerly held, as appears from his <hi>E≈ø≈øay to the Explaining of the Revelation,</hi> which he wrote after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thence: which ≈øhews that he ≈øtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a free and unprejudiced Mind. And here we mu≈øt not forget to do the Protector this right, as to tell the World, that after ≈øome time he was plea≈øed to allow his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoner a Hundred Crowns <hi>per Annum</hi> for his ≈øub≈øi≈øtance, to wit, le≈øt being removed far from his Friends and Imployments, he ≈øhould want Nece≈ø≈øaries. This Bani≈øhment ≈øeems al≈øo to have been beneficial to him on this Account, that it was a means to prevent another of the Protector's Parliaments from decreeing any thing more rigid again≈øt him; being now ab≈øent and out of their way. In this Exile he continued about three Years, notwith≈øtanding all Endeavours of his Friends for his Liberty; and his own Letters, both to the Protector and to Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> (an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Presbyterian Mini≈øter) to rea≈øon them into compa≈ø≈øion. At length, through the Importunity of Friends, and other Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, the Protector ≈øuffer'd a Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to be granted out of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Bench Court</hi> (as it was then called) and to be obeyed by the Governour of <hi>Scilly,</hi> whereby the Pri≈øoner was brought thence, and by that Court ≈øet at liberty, as finding no legal Cau≈øe of detaining him.</p>
            <p>And now, notwith≈øtanding all the≈øe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecutions, Sufferings and Dangers he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto underwent, he was not terrified, from what he counted his Duty to Chri≈øt, in propagating the true knowledg of the only true God, and of Je≈øus Chri≈øt whom he had ≈øent, but return'd to his long inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Exerci≈øes among his Friends. But he could not long labour in this Field, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five Months after, the Protector <hi>Oliver</hi> dies, and his Son <hi>Richard</hi> ≈øucceeding, calls a Parliament, dangerous certainly to <hi>John Bidle</hi> in the fir≈øt place, if to any other; which being fore≈øeen, he was forced as it were, (for he did it with regret,) by the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of a Noble Friend, to retire into the Country during their Se≈ø≈øion. But that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament being di≈ø≈øolv'd, he returned to his wonted Station, till ≈øuch time as the Divi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons between the Protector and Army had brought into Power again the Long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the Divi≈øions of that Parliament, and Army, and People, had brought in General <hi>Monk</hi> out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he the Seclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Members, and they the Exil'd King <hi>Charles,</hi> and with him a re≈øtoration of the Antient Government in Church and State. Then after ≈øome time the liberty of Di≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Wor≈øhippers was taken away, and their Meetings puni≈øh'd as ≈øeditious. Now <hi>J. Bidle</hi> yields to the Time, and re≈øtrains him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:132760:5"/>
from publick to more private A≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. But neither could he long enjoy tho≈øe, however peaceable and harmle≈øs, for on the fir≈øt of <hi>June,</hi> 1662. He was haled out of his Lodgings, where he was conven'd with ≈øome few of his Friends for Divine Wor≈øhip, and carried before Sir <hi>Rich. Brown,</hi> who forthwith committed them all to the publick Pri≈øon; <hi>J. Bidle</hi> to the Dungeon, where he lay for five hours, and was denied the benefit of the Law, which admits Offenders of that ≈øort to Bail for their Appearance. There they lay till the Recorder, moved with more reverence of the Laws, took ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for their an≈øwering to their Charge next Se≈ø≈øions; which they perform'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. But when the Court could not find any Statute whereon to form any Criminal Indictment again≈øt them, they were referr'd to the Se≈ø≈øions following; and then were proceeded again≈øt, by pretext of an Offence again≈øt Common Law, (the Rules of which lie mo≈øtly in the Judges Brea≈øts) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon fined every one of the Hearers in the penalty of Twenty Pounds, and <hi>J. Bidle</hi> in One Hundred; to lie in Pri≈øon till paid. Now though the Sheriff would generou≈øly have been ≈øatisfied with Ten Pounds for him, and he would have paid it, yet the Enmity of Sir <hi>Rich. Brown</hi> was ≈øuch, as he could not be induced to con≈øent thereto up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any terms; but threatn'd him with a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Years Impri≈øonment, though he ≈øhould pay the whole Hundred Pounds; This was the cau≈øe of his continuing in Pri≈øon; but he had not been there full five Weeks, till by rea≈øon of the noi≈øomne≈øs of the Place and pent Air, to him, who≈øe only Recreation and Exerci≈øe had been, for many Years, to walk daily into the free Air, he contracted a Di≈øea≈øe, which in a few days, alas, put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to his Life. In this Extremity Sir <hi>R. Brown</hi> could not be moved to grant the Sick Pri≈øoner the pre≈øent Comfort of a Removal, in order to a Recovery; but Sheriff <hi>Meynel,</hi> to the prai≈øe of his great Humanity, did grant it: But, alas, the ≈øecond Day after his removal, between five and ≈øix a Clock in the Morning, the 22th of <hi>September</hi> 1662. he quietly gave up his Spirit to God. He was then in the ≈øtrength of his Age, the 47th Year of his Life. Now it did appear, (as he had ≈øaid formerly) that by frequent Meditations of the Re≈øurrection and future Happine≈øs, he had made Death contemptible to him≈øelf. For as ≈øoon, as by the Di≈øea≈øe more ≈øtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly annoying his Brain, he perceiv'd a great Alteration, he ≈øignified it to his Friends, and would not be induced to any Di≈øcour≈øe, but compos'd him≈øelf as it were to ≈øleep, during that eight hours time, which after that he liv'd, being very ≈øparing of Words, or indeed of Groans, that might argue any Impatience; notwith≈øtanding, when a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pious Matron, who mini≈øtred to him, broke forth into this (as it were) Farewel-≈øaying, <hi>God grant we may ≈øee one another in the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> He, now his Speech failing, left up his quivering Hand, ≈øhewing thereby (it ≈øeems) how plea≈øing that Wi≈øh was to him. And that he was not ≈øurpriz'd with dying at this time, may be collected from his often ≈øaying before, That if he ≈øhould be once more ca≈øt into Pri≈øon, he ≈øhould never be re≈øtor'd to Liberty; and moreover, <hi>That the Work was done,</hi> meaning, That that Truth which God had rais'd him up to profe≈øs, was ≈øufficiently brought to light, there wanted only Ingenuity in Men, for the embracing and acknowledging it.</p>
            <p>Having in this manner de≈øcribed the Cour≈øe of <hi>John Bidle</hi>'s Life, it may perhaps be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, why being ≈øo learned and able a Man, he publi≈øhed ≈øo few Books, e≈øpecially being provoked by divers An≈øwers to what he did publi≈øh, to which he did not reply? To this it may be an≈øwered, fir≈øt, That he was verily per≈øwaded, that Truth being in it ≈øelf plain and ≈øimple, e≈øpecially what is nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and very u≈øeful, is ea≈øy to be apprehended by few words; it's Error that ≈øeeks Garni≈øh in many Words and Figures of Speech. Again, what he did publi≈øh, he well deliberated of; ≈øo that he did not find in the adver≈øe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, any thing of moment, which an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Reader might not perceive already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated: And they that attend not to the fir≈øt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:132760:6"/>
Propo≈øitions, will not receive benefit by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies and Rejoinders. We add, that he treading in a Path, long over-grown with Briars and Thorns of Error and Sophi≈øtry, it requir'd va≈øtly greater Labour and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to find out the Way of Truth, in which no Engli≈øh-Man had by any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing Foot-≈øteeps gone before him for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages.</p>
            <p>But that which in my Judgment does more commend our <hi>John Bidle,</hi> than all his Labours and Sufferings for the propagation of great and important Truths, is his great Zeal for promoting Holine≈øs of Life and Manners; for this was always his End and De≈øign in what he taught. He valued not his Doctrines for Speculation but Practice; in≈øomuch that he would not di≈øcour≈øe of tho≈øe Points wherein he differed from others, with tho≈øe that appear'd not religious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Knowledg. Neither could he bear tho≈øe that di≈ø≈øembled in Profe≈ø≈øion for Worldly Intere≈øts. He was a ≈øtrict Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerver him≈øelf, and a ≈øevere Exactor in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of reverence in ≈øpeaking of God, and Chri≈øt, and Holy Things; ≈øo that he would by no means hear their Names, or any Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Holy Scripture us'd vainly or light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, much le≈øs any fooli≈øh Talking, or Scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. He would often tell his Friends, that no Religion would benefit a bad Man; and call upon them to re≈øolve with them≈øelves, as well to profe≈øs and practi≈øe the Truth that is according to Godline≈øs, as to ≈øtudy to find it out; and that again≈øt all Terrors or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements to the contrary; being a≈ø≈øured that nothing di≈øplea≈øing to Almighty God, could be in any wi≈øe profitable to them. But as for tho≈øe that were really of a contrary Mind to him, how mean ≈øoever, (for he was very humble and conde≈øcending) they could not oblige him more, than by pertinent Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ≈øoberly urg'd, to give him the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of re≈øolving them; which he always did with great ≈øimplicity and plainne≈øs of Speech, without any o≈øtentation of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which yet he was as much ma≈øter of, as tho≈øe mo≈øt famous on that Account. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his Learning in Matters of Religion was gain'd by a diligent ≈øtudy of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, e≈øpecially of the New Te≈øtament, wherein he was ≈øo conver≈øant, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd it all in his Memory <hi>verbatim,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Engli≈øh, but in Greek, as far as the Fourth Chapter of <hi>the Revelation of St. John.</hi> This thorow-knowledg in the Scriptures, join'd with an ordinary, happy, and ready Memory, whereby he retain'd al≈øo the Sum of what he had read in other Authors, gave him great advantage again≈øt all Opponents, and in all Di≈øcour≈øes, but without the lea≈øt appearance of boa≈øting.</p>
            <p>I could mention many other things, which ≈øhew that it was in his Heart to promote Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and that he had no de≈øign of aggrandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing his Name by oppo≈øition to common Doctrins. Indeed, he was a great A≈ø≈øerter of common Doctrines again≈øt Noval Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that tended either to Sedition, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tini≈øm, or Super≈øtition. And in what he held contrary to the Current, he did not endeavour to tie tho≈øe he had won, to be of his Mind in ≈øuch a Society, and by ≈øuch a Society, and by ≈øuch bands, as might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue them a ≈øucce≈ø≈øive Party, bearing his Name as their Founder, but left them at all that liberty, which the Duty of owning the Truth according to their Con≈øcience, and of mutual edification, would allow them. And as no tincture of Ambition did appear in him, ≈øo neither of the lea≈øt degree of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting worldly Gain: for he always ≈øu≈øtain'd him≈øelf by his own Indu≈øtry, when he was in capacity of u≈øing it; and would never accept of any Supplies, tho offer'd; but when his Nece≈ø≈øities, ari≈øing from Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonment, Sickne≈øs, or the like, forc'd him to it, (Except that after his ≈øeven Years re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtraint, a friendly Citizen of <hi>London</hi> impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd him to take a Bed and Board with him; and after his Deliverance from <hi>Scilly</hi> another did the like) for he had learn'd to be contented with a little, and ≈øought not more, yea out of that little would contribute to the Nece≈ø≈øities of others. Temperance was at all times mo≈øt con≈øpicuous in him, as well in eating as in drinking: and he thought it not enough to be very cha≈øt, but that he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:132760:6"/>
ought to avoid all ≈øu≈øpicion of uncha≈øtity; in≈øomuch that he would not willingly look upon a Woman without ju≈øt occa≈øion; and was very unea≈øy, if left in a room with one alone, till reliev'd by more Company.</p>
            <p>I have ≈øpoken above of the Reverence and Gravity he us'd him≈øelf, and exacted of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in handling of Holy Things; in other matters he would be merry and plea≈øant, and liked well that the Company ≈øhould be ≈øo too; yet even in this common Conver≈øe, he always retain'd an awe of the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, and was ≈øometimes ob≈øerv'd to lift up his Hand ≈øuddenly; which tho≈øe that were intimate with him, knew to be an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a ≈øecret Ejaculation. But in his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øet-Devotions, he was wont often to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate him≈øelf upon the Ground, after the manner of our Saviour in his Agony, and would commend that Po≈øture of Wor≈øhip al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo to his mo≈øt intimate Friends. But his Devotion toward God, and ≈øtudy for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating Divine Truth, did not, as in ≈øome Per≈øons, ≈øwallow up his Ju≈øtice and Charity toward Men, for he was as careful a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti≈øer and promoter of tho≈øe Virtues, as his Opinion of their Nece≈ø≈øity to Salvation did require.</p>
            <p>In fine, many more things might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, which might demon≈øtrate <hi>John Bidle,</hi> to have been a Man, if any in this la≈øt Age, mo≈øt eminent for Piety and Virtue, as well as Learning and Knowledg. But thus much at lea≈øt was due to his Memory, not only to vindicate him from tho≈øe Depraved Affections that encline Men to Here≈øy, and to be the Authors of new Sects: but to give the World an Example of a ≈øincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former.</p>

            <p>HAving now attended for the ≈øpace of ≈øixteen Months, partly in the Country, and partly in <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> that I might come to my An≈øwer before the Parliament; and finding, after all this tarriance, that I am ≈øtill as far from having my Cau≈øe determined as ever: I am even forced to make my Addre≈øs to you, and to be≈øeech you, if you have any Bowels towards them that are in Mi≈øery, that you would either procure my Di≈øcharge, or at lea≈øt make Report to the Hou≈øe touching my denial of the ≈øuppo≈øed Deity of the Holy Spirit. For that this only is the Matter in Conte≈øtation, you very well know, having both heard my Confe≈ø≈øion before the Committee, and remembring how, when I was urged to declare my Judgment concerning the Deity of Chri≈øt, I waved the Que≈øtion, as neither being that I was accu≈øed of, nor which I had yet ≈øufficiently ≈øtudied, to engage my ≈øelf publickly therein. As for my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on touching the Holy Spirit, it is thus: <hi>I believe the Holy Spirit to be the chief of all</hi>

               <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will ≈øend him unto you.

I have yet many things to ≈øay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of Truth, is come, he will guide you into all Truth; for he ≈øhall not ≈øpeak of him≈øelf; but what≈øoever he ≈øhall hear, that ≈øhall he ≈øpeak; and he ≈øhall ≈øhew you things to come. He ≈øhall glorify me; for he ≈øhall receive of mine, and ≈øhall ≈øhew it unto you. All things that the Father hath, are mine: therefore ≈øaid I, he ≈øhall take of mine, and ≈øhew it unto you.]</hi> Rom. 8.26, 27. <hi>Likewi≈øe the Spirit al≈øo helpeth our Infirmities; for we know not what we ≈øhould pray for as we ought: but the Spirit him≈øelf maketh interce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion for us, with Groans that cannot be uttered. But he that ≈øearcheth the Hearts, knoweth what is the Mind (or De≈øire) of the Spirit: for he maketh interce≈ø≈øion for the Saints according to the Will of God.]</hi> Acts 19.2. <hi>And (Paul) finding certain Di≈øciples, ≈øaid unto them, Have ye received the Holy Spirit ≈øince ye believed? And they ≈øaid unto him, We have not ≈øo much as heard whether there be any Holy Spirit.]</hi> Ephe≈ø. 4.4, 5, 6. <hi>There is one Body, and one Spirit, even as ye have been called in one Hope of your Calling.

Wherefore I give you to under≈øtand, that no Man ≈øpeaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Je≈øus accur≈øed; and that no Man can ≈øay that Je≈øus is the Lord, but by the Holy Spirit; but there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øities of Gifts, yet the ≈øame Spirit. And there are diver≈øities of Admini≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet the ≈øame Lord; and there are diver≈øities of Operations, yet it is the ≈øame God that worketh all in all.]</hi> Luk. 3.21, 22. <hi>It came to pa≈øs that Je≈øus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo

For what Man knoweth the things of a Man, ≈øave the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a Man, which is in him? even ≈øo the things of God knoweth none, but the Spirit of God,</hi> (he doth not add, as before, <hi>which is in him.) Now we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given us of God.]</hi> Rev. 22.12, 17. <hi>Behold, I come quickly, and my Reward is with me, to give unto every Man according as his Work ≈øhall be: and the Spirit and the Bride ≈øay, Come.]</hi> Act. 5.32. <hi>And we are his Witne≈ø≈øes of the≈øe things, and ≈øo is al≈øo the Holy Spirit, whom God hath given to them that obey him.]</hi> Gal. 3.5. <hi>He therefore that mini≈øtreth (or giveth) to you the Spirit, and worketh Miracles among you, doth he it by the Works of the Law, or by the Hearing (or rather, Preaching) of Faith?] He that mini≈øtreth, or giveth the Spirit to you;</hi> a ≈øtrange kind of Speech, if the Holy Gho≈øt were God. The Scripture is wont to ≈øpeak more ≈øoberly of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, than to ≈øay that he is given by another, much le≈øs by Men, as it is here ≈øaid of the Holy Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4. <hi>We know that an Idol is nothing in the World, and that there is no other God but one. For though there be that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods, whether in Heaven or in Earth; as there be many Gods, and many Lords, yet unto us there is but one God, even the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, even Je≈øus Chri≈øt, by whom are all things, and we by him.]</hi> You ≈øee here, that the Apo≈øtle being about to ≈øet down, who is the only God, and only Lord of Chri≈øtians, maketh no mention of the Holy Spirit; which could not have been done by ≈øo faithful an Apo≈øtle, had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit been either God or Lord. Of the≈øe Places thus recited, no Man, tho never ≈øo ≈øubtile, and tho he turn and wind his Wit every way, ≈øhall ever be able to make Sen≈øe, unle≈øs he take the Holy Spirit to be what I ≈øay.</p>
            <p>Behold now the Cau≈øe for which I have lien under Per≈øecution, rai≈øed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt me by my Adver≈øaries; who being unable to ju≈øtify by Argument their Practice of giving Glory to the Holy Spirit, as God, in the end of their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ≈øince there is neither Precept nor Example for it in all the Scripture; and being taxed by me for giving the Glory of God to another, and wor≈øhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping what he hath not commanded, nor ever came into his Heart, have, in a cruel and unchri≈øtian manner, re≈øorted to the Arm of Fle≈øh, and in≈øtigated the Magi≈øtrate again≈øt me, hoping by his Sword, (not that of the Spirit) to uphold their Will-wor≈øhip; but in vain, ≈øince every Plant that the Heavenly Father hath not ≈øet, ≈øhall be rooted up. And that this practice of Wor≈øhipping the Holy Spirit as God, is ≈øuch a Plant as God never ≈øet in his Word, would

≈øoon appear to the Honourable Hou≈øe, could they be but ≈øo far prevailed with, as, laying a≈øide all Prejudice, ≈øeriou≈øly to weigh the many and ≈øolid Proofs that I produce for my Opinion out of the Scripture, together with the ≈ølight, or rather no Proofs of the adver≈øe Party for their Opinion; which they them≈øelves know not what to make of, but that they endeavour to delude both them≈øelves and others with Per≈øonalities, Moods, Sub≈øi≈øtences, and ≈øuch like brain-≈øick Notions, that have neither ≈øap nor ≈øence in them, and were fir≈øt hatched by the ≈øubtility of Satan in the Heads of Platoni≈øts, to pervert the Wor≈øhip of the True God. Neither could this Controver≈øy be ≈øet on foot in a fitter juncture of time than this; wherein the Parliament and Kingdom have ≈øolemnly engaged them≈øelves to reform Religion, both in Di≈øcipline and Doctrine. For among≈øt all the Corruptions in Doctrine, which certainly are many, there is none that more de≈øerveth to be amended than this, that ≈øo palpably thwarteth the whole tenour of the Scripture, and trencheth to the very Object of our Wor≈øhip, and therefore ought not to be lightly pa≈ø≈øed over by any Man that profe≈ø≈øeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf a Chri≈øtian, much more a Reformer. God is jealous of his Honour, and will not give it to another; we therefore, as beloved Children, ≈øhould imitate our Heavenly Father herein, and not upon any pretence what≈øoever depart from his expre≈øs Command, and give the Wor≈øhip of the ≈øupreme Lord of Heaven and Earth, to him whom the Scripture no-where affirmeth to be God. For my own particular, after a long impartial inquiry of the Truth, in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øy, and after much and earne≈øt calling upon God, to give unto me the Spirit of Wi≈ødom and Revelation in the knowledg of him; I find my ≈øelf obliged, both by the Principles of Scripture and of Rea≈øon, to embrace the Opinion I now hold forth; and as much as in me lieth, to endeavour that the Honour of Almighty God be not transferred to another, not only to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of God him≈øelf, but al≈øo of his Holy Spirit, who cannot but be grieved to have that ignorantly a≈øcribed to him≈øelf, which is proper to God that ≈øends him, and which he no-where challengeth to him≈øelf in the Scripture. What ≈øhall befal me in the pur≈øuance of this Work, I refer to the di≈øpo≈øal of the all-wi≈øe God, who≈øe Glory is dearer to me, not only than my Liberty, but than my Life. It will be your part, Honoured Sir, into who≈øe hands God hath put ≈øuch an Opportunity, to examine the Bu≈øine≈øs impartially, and to be an helper to the Truth, con≈øidering that this Controver≈øy is of the greate≈øt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the World, and that the Divine Truth ≈øuffers her ≈øelf not to be de≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed Scot-free. Neither let the meanne≈øs of my outward pre≈øence deter you from ≈øtirring, ≈øince it is the part of a wi≈øe Man, as in all things, ≈øo e≈øpecially in Matters of Religion, not to regard ≈øo much who it is that ≈øpeaketh, as what it is that is ≈øpoken; remembring how our Saviour in the Go≈øpel ≈øaith, That God
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:132760:9"/>
is wont to hide his Secrets from the Wi≈øe and Prudent, and to reveal them unto Children. In which number I willingly reckon my ≈øelf, being con≈øcious of mine own per≈øonal Weakne≈øs, but well a≈ø≈øured of the Strength and Evidence of the Scripture to bear me out in this Cau≈øe; and remain</p>
